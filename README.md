# superuser-cluster
{Data analysis} User clustering to identify superusers/supercustomers

# Background
In order to fully grasp the impact of this process, I recommend first reading Chamath Palihapitiya on the growth principles that got Facebook to billions of users.
Chamath was the senior executive at Facebook that was responsible for turning the company around when the core user base was declining in 2007.

The purpose of clustering the users is to identify who the superusers are. This will allow a PM to understand the commonalities in their user-journey. By doing so, PMs can formulate strategies to turn new and existing users into superusers.

# Glossary
 - Super-user (super-customer): A user that has shown a deep NEED for a product. For a product manager, this is a user that maximizes the product's key metrics such as LTV, engagement, and retention.
 - New user: A user that has started using a product. This user has not been using the product for long, but has not become a churned user. Usually, these users have not yet completed the onboarding phase yet, and have not experienced the entirety of the core product. Sometimes, PMs put an arbitrary threshold to label new users: "Used the product for less than 7 days".
 - Churned user: A user that completely stopped using a product.
 - Existing users: All other users. It's important to note that a PM should further categorize existing users to better focus their product strategies.
 - Note: We can further create more user categories - but for now, let's just bucket all of them as existing users.
